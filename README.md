# odin-recipes
Odin recipes is a website where you'll see diferent meals you can cook.

In this project i'm going to use the next some concepts that iÂ´ve been learning.

How to create an HTML file
Boilerplate HTML
Use basics HTML tags and elements like:
    <ol>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <h1>
    <p>
    <a>
and more...

At these point this webpage doesn't have CSS file, so it's plain text. 
Enjoy the recipes!
